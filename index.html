				<strong>The origins of frozen desserts</strong>
				are obscure although several accounts exist about their history. Some
				sources describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far
				back as 550 BCE while others claim that the Roman Emperor Nero had ice
				collected from the Apennine Mountains to produce the first sorbet mixed
				with honey and wine. Although sorbets are believed to have been invented
				in Persia, other accounts say ice cream originated in the Mongol Empire
				and first spread to China during its expansion. Its spread throughout
				Europe is sometimes attributed to Arab traders, but more often to Marco
				Polo. Though it's not mentioned in any of his writings, Polo is often
				credited with introducing sorbet-style desserts to Italy after learning
				of it during his travels to China. The Italian duchess Catherine de'
				Medici is said to have introduced flavored sorbet ices to France when
				she brought some Italian chefs with her to France upon marrying the Duke
				of Orl√©ans (Henry II of France) in 1533. One hundred years later,
				Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the "frozen snow"
				that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for
				keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal
				prerogative. There is no evidence to support any of these legends.
